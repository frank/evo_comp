# Evolutionary Computing Assignment
Implementation of a differential evolution algorithm for which we wrote a paper investigating the effect of dynamic hyperparameter values. The algorithm was submitted to our class' contest, for which it achieved to consistently find the global maximum in two of the three evaluation functions.

Functions (10 dimensional):
- Katsuura: 10/10
- Schaffers: 10/10
- Bent Cigar: 9.9999/10
